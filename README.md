# Abstract
The main objective of this project is to develop a home automation system using an Arduino board with Bluetooth being remotely controlled by an app. As technology is advancing so houses are also getting smarter. Modern houses are gradually shifting from conventional switches to centralized control systems, involving remote controlled switches. Presently, conventional wall switches located in different parts of the house make it difficult for the user to go near them to operate. Even more it becomes more difficult for the elderly or physically handicapped people to do so. Remote controlled home automation systems provide the most modern solution with smart phones. To achieve this, a Bluetooth module is interfaced to the Arduino board at the receiver end while on the transmitter end, a GUI application sends ON/OFF commands to the receiver where loads are connected. By touching the specified location on the GUI, the loads can be turned ON/OFF remotely through this technology. The loads are operated by Arduino board.
