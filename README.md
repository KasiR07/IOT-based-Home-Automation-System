# IOT-based-Home-Automation-System
The main objective of this project is to develop a home automation system using an Arduino board with Bluetooth being remotely controlled by an app. As technology is advancing so houses are also getting smarter. Modern houses are gradually shifting from conventional switches to centralized control systems, involving remote controlled switches.
